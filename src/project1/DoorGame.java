/**
 * Determines the probabilities of the "Door Game". The game goes as following: 
 * 
 * "The following game was played on a popular television show. The host showed a contestant three large curtains. 
 * Behind one of the curtains was a nice prize (maybe a new car) and behind the other two curtains were worthless 
 * prizes (duds). The contestant was asked to choose one curtain. Before showing the 
 * contestant what was behind the curtain initially chosen, the game show host would open one of the curtains 
 * and show the contestant one of the duds. He then offered the contestant the option 
 * of changing from the curtain initially selected to the other remaining unopened curtain. Which strategy 
 * maximizes the contestantâ€™s probability of winning the good prize: stay with the initial choice or 
 * switch to the other curtain?
 * 
 * 1.) The simple events probabilities would be: P(D1) = P(D2) = P(P) = 1/3
 * 2a.) The probability of winning the good prize is 1/3.
 * 2b.) If the contestant is shown a dud and she selected P, they will switch to a dud.
 * 2c.) If the contestant is shown a dud and she selected D, they will switch to a prize.
 * 2d.) If the contestant switches their door, the chances of a prize is 2/3.
 * 2e.) Switching doors is the best strategy.
